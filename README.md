## Winsock Client/Server Example \-\- Every Line Commented


</div>

### Description

Well, I just now finished my Winsock Client/Server example. I wrote this with the intention of people learning from it. That's why I commented every single line in the whole program. It shows you how to do the following:

1) Setup a multi-user server

2) Write your own winsock client

3) Login with a username and password

4) Send data to all connected sockets

5) Write your own commands that the user types

6) Save and load files

7) Work with common dialogs

It has more options than I have listed here. You'll have to download and check it out for yourself, you will not be disappointed.

For directions on how to use this program. See the client example. Everything you need to know is in there.

If you download this, please give me some feed back. I spent about 3 hours writing this, it's the least you could do.
